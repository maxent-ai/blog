    "text": "Stakeholders, Objectives & the Objective interplay\nIn a multi-sided system with multiple objectives often the objectives interact and behave in different manners. At a high level, you could categorize the different types of these interplay as follows:\n\nCorrelated : Optimising for one objective helps the other.\nNeutral: Optimising for one does not impact the other\nAnti Correlated: Optimising for one hurts the other\n\nConsider the example of our Hypothetical on-demand delivery startup Hyper, which is a three-sided marketplace - i.e it has three sets of stakeholders with different motivations & objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder\nNeeds/Motivations\nPotential Objectives\n\n\n\n\nEnd User\nWants to order something from local partner shops.\n\nQuick delivery\nBest price\nReliable merchants\nFresh items\n\n\n\nMerchants\nProvide online visibility and find customers.\n\nMatching quality\nExposure\nMinimise wastage\n\n\n\nDelivery Partners\nEarn a stable livelihood.\n\nRegularity in jobs\nEarnings per partner\nEfficient drop location planning\n\n\n\n\nAs we see above each entity has a unique set of potential objectives one could optimise the recommendation system for & this has to be done in a deliberate and careful way or it might result in undesired outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüßµ Superstar economics and towards a fair marketplace\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from Microsoft & Spotify found out that:\n\nRecommendation systems in general suffer from what is called as an inherent problem of ‚Äúsuperstar economics‚Äù: rankings have a top and a tail end, not just for popularity, but also for relevance. In an attempt to maximize user satisfaction, recommender system optimize for relevance. This inadvertently leads to lock-in of popular and relevant suppliers, especially for users who want to minimize the effort required to interact with the system. A major side-effect of the superstar economics is the impedance to suppliers on the tail-end of the spectrum, who struggle to attract consumers, given the low exposure, and thus, are not satisfied with the marketplace. Indeed, to continue to attract more suppliers to the platform, marketplaces face an interesting problem of optimizing their models for supplier exposure, and visibility. Indeed, the suppliers (e.g.¬†retailers, artists) would want a fair opportunity to be presented to the users.\n\nread more about this in Towards a Fair Marketplace: Counterfactual Evaluation of the trade-off between Relevance, Fairness & Satisfaction in Recommendation Systems\n\n\n\nIn short, what a system optimises for is super important & in general, it needs to look for a balance while optimising for various objectives."
