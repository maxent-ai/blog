    "section": "Stakeholders, Objectives & the Objective interplay",
    "text": "Stakeholders, Objectives & the Objective interplay\nIn a multi-sided system with multiple objectives often the objectives interact and behave in different manners. At a high level, you could categorize the different types of these interplay as follows:\n\nCorrelated : Optimising for one objective helps the other.\nNeutral: Optimising for one does not impact the other\nAnti Correlated: Optimising for one hurts the other\n\nConsider the example of our Hypothetical on-demand delivery startup Hyper, which is a three-sided marketplace - i.e it has three sets of stakeholders with different motivations & objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder\nNeeds/Motivations\nPotential Objectives\n\n\n\n\nEnd User\nWants to order something from local partner shops.\n\nQuick delivery\nBest price\nReliable merchants\nFresh items\n\n\n\nMerchants\nProvide online visibility and find customers.\n\nMatching quality\nExposure\nMinimise wastage\n\n\n\nDelivery Partners\nEarn a stable livelihood.\n\nRegularity in jobs\nEarnings per partner\nEfficient drop location planning\n\n\n\n\nAs we see above each entity has a unique set of potential objectives one could optimise the recommendation system for & this has to be done in a deliberate and careful way or it might result in undesired outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüßµ Superstar economics and towards a fair marketplace\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from Microsoft & Spotify found out that:\n\nRecommendation systems in general suffer from what is called as an inherent problem of ‚Äúsuperstar economics‚Äù: rankings have a top and a tail end, not just for popularity, but also for relevance. In an attempt to maximize user satisfaction, recommender system optimize for relevance. This inadvertently leads to lock-in of popular and relevant suppliers, especially for users who want to minimize the effort required to interact with the system. A major side-effect of the superstar economics is the impedance to suppliers on the tail-end of the spectrum, who struggle to attract consumers, given the low exposure, and thus, are not satisfied with the marketplace. Indeed, to continue to attract more suppliers to the platform, marketplaces face an interesting problem of optimizing their models for supplier exposure, and visibility. Indeed, the suppliers (e.g.¬†retailers, artists) would want a fair opportunity to be presented to the users.\n\nread more about this in Towards a Fair Marketplace: Counterfactual Evaluation of the trade-off between Relevance, Fairness & Satisfaction in Recommendation Systems\n\n\n\nIn short, what a system optimises for is super important & in general, it needs to look for a balance while optimising for various objectives.\nBefore we proceed further on the track of optimising for multiple objectives (or multiple objective optimisation) - let us quickly visit how most modern recommendation systems look like & also do a quick recap of how one builds a model for ranking (aka Learning to rank) & some key metrics used for measuring these systems."

    "title": "Rank, Rank & Rank: A Primer",
    "section": "Pointwise method",
    "text": "Pointwise method\nIn pointwise method, the above ranking task is re-formulated as a standard classification/regression task. The function to be learned \\(f(q, D)\\) is simplified as \\(f(q, d_i)\\) i.e the relevance of each document given a query is scored independently.\nFor instance, if we have two queries associated with 2 and 3 resulting matched documents:\n\n\\(q_1 \\to d_1, d_2\\)\n\\(q_2 \\to d_3, d_4, d_5\\)\n\nThen the training data \\(x_i\\) in a pointwise method will essentially be every query-document pair as follows:\n\n\\(x_1 : q_1, d_1\\)\n\\(x_2 : q_1, d_2\\)\n\\(x_3 : q_2, d_3\\)\n\\(x_4 : q_2, d_4\\)\n\\(x_5 : q_2, d_5\\)\n\nSince each document is scored independently with the absolute relevance as the target label, the task is no different from any standard classification or regression task. As such any standard ml algorithms can be levergaed in this setting.\n\nAdvantage: Simplicity, Any standard ML models can be redily applied\nDisadvantage: The results can be often sub-optimal due to not utilizing the full information of the entire list of matching documents for each query & This requires explicit labels while constructing the dataset, and can be quite expensive."

    "text": "Pairwise method\nIn pairwise method, the goal is to learn a pointwise scoring function \\(f(q, d_i)\\) similar to a pointwise formulation. However, the key difference arises in how the training data is consructed - where we take pairs of documents within the same query as training samples.\n\n\\(x_1 \\to q_1, (d_1, d_2)\\)\n\\(x_2 \\to q_1, (d_3, d_4)\\)\n\\(x_3 \\to q_1, (d_3, d_5)\\)\n\\(x_4 \\to q_1, (d_4, d_5)\\)\n\nIn this setting, a new set of pairwise binary labels are derived, by comapring the individual relevance score in each pair. For example, given the first query \\(q_1\\)\n\nAdvantage: We don‚Äôt need explicit labels, Only pairwise preferences are required. This is an advantage because sometimes we are only able to infer the pairwise preference from collected user behavior & the model learns how to rank directly, even though its a pairwise setting, but in theory it can approximate the performance of a general ranking task.\nDisadvantage: The Core Scoring mechanism is still pointwise. Hence, that relative information in the feature space among different documents given the same query is still not fully leveraged."
