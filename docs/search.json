    "text": "It took humans less than a decade to reach a level of sophistication to reach a stage where with less than a couple of keystrokes on a phone one could get the most elaborate meal delivered at home. Thatâ€™s the magic of the internet revolution. In recent times this trend has only gotten sharper and sharper, with the on-demand delivery space heating up, an Indian consumer can receive anything from an egg to the most lavish dinner faster than it takes to respond to a slack message, in fact as of 2022 - you can get most things delivered under 10 minutes!\nThe implication of this is that the customers do not need to plan anything much in advance and that the time between desire, action, and gratification has shrunk to almost zero. One such Hypothetical unicorn startup in this space is Hyper - Which started just over two years ago and has seen massive growth in a short period.\nHyper is known mainly for its super fast, sub-10-minute delivery of almost anything that one can think of! However, In the past couple of weeks, the sentiment trends around sub-10-minute style deliveries seem to be sharply negative due to various factors especially concerned around the lack of empathy towards Hyperâ€™s delivery partners. What was once a strength seems to be turning into pain for the company and many are asking if we have gone too far.\nWithin this Hypothetical backdrop where Hyper is reevaluating its business strategy, Hyperâ€™s engineering team setâ€™s forth on a journey to contribute towards its initiative of bringing a bit more balance within the marketplace. This marketplace is not overly user-centric but also is fair for other stakeholders like a delivery partners as well.\nEnter recommendation systems, systems that sit at the heart of how most digital marketplaces perform. Most of the digital economies are shaped by these systems - the scale, convenience, and speed of marketplaces like Hyper are enabled by recommendation systems and search engines. Hence, what these systems optimize for and how they behave are of critical importance. Within a marketplace, there are a lot of factors that come into play, and the success of any given marketplace is closely tied to how you match, cater & satisfy the requirements of all the stakeholders like the consumers, suppliers, and more.\nIn a series of articles, letâ€™s dive deeper into how these systems are designed, and optimized and explore their inner workings and also learn how these systems (or parts of them, to be precise) can be built in practice.\nBut first, letâ€™s establish a couple of definitions, terms & concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nðŸ§µ Marketplace, marketplace differentiators & superstar economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace: An intermediary that helps facilitate economic interaction between two or more sets of agents, these have existed since time immemorial as local markets to shopping malls to modern digital experiences like amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, Instacart, etc - in fact, they are pretty much everywhere.\nDifferentiating factors of a marketplace: Marketplaces come in various shapes and sizes, but at a high level they can be differentiated based on Need/Customer coverage (horizontal vs vertical), Participant type (b2b vs b2c), Type of offering (service, goods, information, etc). They can also be differentiated based on control and functionality styles (open, closed, focused, censored, etc), management approach (unmanaged, lite, or fully managed) & lastly their transaction regularity (one-off & repeat transactions).\nSuperstar economics: The Phenomenon of superstars, wherein a relatively small number of people earn enormous amounts of money or value of some form and dominate the activities in which they engage."
